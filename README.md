    About:
        This Crude Wget Gui was written to make access to files on certain web platforms 
        easier and faster.  It is provided as is without warranty of any kind.  Use at
        your own risk.  This project was written to be very simple and effective at a
        small set of things and is not intended to replace command line wget.  There
        are more functional and full featured graphical interfaces for this application,
        the goal for this project is simplicity.  If a feature can be added and the
        simplicity maintained, please feel free to add it and send me a pull request or
